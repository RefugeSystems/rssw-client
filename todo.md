				! Create new serverside class for entities

        + Archetype Changes
        √ Stat Changes

# Bugs
√ Paged Table  
        + Doesn't properly follow current filter at load
        + When changing data sources and beyond the highest page, doesn't backtrack well
        + Changing data source seems problematic in general with regard to page
+ Info "Back" button needs to rewind base and target as well as record

# UIs
√ Shop Interface
√ Bag Info Display
√ Ship Display  
        + Passenger Manifest  
                + Entities with "Inside" that entity set
                + May need a helper function to index this changing for speed purposes, but not likely
√ Update Location output with contained entities  
        + Including Sublocations and Entities in those locations
        + Entities sitting in entities can be skipped
√ History Display  
        + Widget for entity
√ Master set location control  
        + Under location - Set location for a party
        + From the galaxy, add locations to target list and allow entities to have location set
√ Galaxy add location column (For location name)  
        + Possibly limited to entity & location types
√ Knowledge table widget for entities to list knowledge
		+ Only updates when the entity updates and the length of knowledge differs from the current cache
		+ Should cache a translation of the knowledge array for the table to index and sort nicely
		+ Self contained description display to allow multiple knowledges to be viewed at once
+ Info comparison state to "store" the current record for comparison that can be closed from a side-by-side view
		+ Give a "DIFF" for any calculated fields?
√ Clicking on a skill in character view sets it up for leveling
		+ This will involve $emit & v-on
		+ Clicking it while it is set for leveling opens info
		+ An info icon appears next to the selected skill for leveling
√ Add custom skills to skill area widget for entities
+ Need UI for controling Entity widgets for display (Simple list, stores to entity)
√ Roll Dice
		+ Universe needs a way to specify its available dice configurations
		+ Roller needs to be able to select from the available dice configurations
√ Historical note taking Widget at a player level, maybe save to player itself
		+ Has a "current" note
		+ Has a scrolling collapsable list of previous notes
		+ Clicking previous notes opens info tab
		+ Clicking the "edit" on a previous note moves it to "current"
		+ Notes sort by name only with a toggable direction
		+ Listing has a filter that searches the `_search` key for deeper information

# Functions
√ Restock Shop
