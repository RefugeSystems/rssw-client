# About the RSSWx Project

of the version) should match to ensure communication.

# Getting Started
Once cloned, run `npm install` to install the necessary modules and then run `grunt` to "start" development. This will start testing and linting in the background,
start a local web server with the pages assembled, open a web browser to the hosted site, and watch for changes to refresh the page.
